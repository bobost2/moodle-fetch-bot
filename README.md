# ⚠️ The project is not in a finished state yet
### TODO:
- ✔️ Discord authentication
- ⚠️ Show server list (has issues)
- ✔️ Course select
- 👉 Bot configuration (working on it)
- ❌ Downloading the course contents to the database
- ❌ Posting in the Discord channel the course updates
- ❌ Being able to remove the bot or delete account
# What is the purpose of this bot?
I have a "specific" course in the university, where the teacher is just lazy to announce homeworks or other events in class and when he posts a homework in Moodle, nobody gets notification and we are kinda forced to check the app every day, which no one does and everybody misses their homework. 
So the solution is to create a bot, who checks the contents instead of you and if any changes are detected (like posting homework or something else), to notify you via Discord chat (in a server).
# Doesn't this exist?
It may exist in some form or another, but:
- I want to make it myself
- It's not that customisable as I want
- It's looking only for homework (I want to scan the entire course instead)
